## What is Contentful?

[Contentful](https://www.contentful.com) provides a content infrastructure for digital teams to power content in websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Contentful was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship digital products faster.

## Requirements

This package requires PHP 8.0 or above.

## About

This package provides foundation components for both [Delivery SDK](https://github.com/contentful/contentful.php) and [Management SDK](https://github.com/contentful/contentful-management.php), and it is not meant for being used from third party packages.
